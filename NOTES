This program should create a random playlist based on the folders
in a dir. I.E. we don't want to shuffle by episode (or song) we want
to shuffle by series (or album). This will be done recursively with a
binary tree. The tree will contain a path field, an included field (has
this path been added to the list yet?), and a pointer to the next node.

For now we will make the top level dir configurable only at compile
time. And the program will only provide a shuffled list (maybe this
could be a commandline flag in the future).

The algorithm will be fairly simple and ineffiecent for now but could
be improved later.

In the future:
- Specify top level dir on commandline?
- Toggle shuffling?

Tree Layout:
If we have a dir layout like this:
a
a/b
a/b/c
a/d
a/e/f

The tree should look like this:

 a
 |
 |
 > b
   |
   |
   > c
     |
     |
   d <
   |
   v
   e
   |
   |
   > f
